Steps I did:

1) Scanned the machine using rustscan
2) Visited the webpages. Checked for robots.txt and source code
3) Ran GoBuster on both http services
4) Downloaded images for steganography
5) Cracked md5 hashes online
6) Logged in to SSH and got user.txt
7) Enumerated the machine for privesc. Vulnerable cronjob running as root
8) Since the cronjob is ours, I edited it and put a reverse shell on it and
waited for it to run. You should have a shell running as root.
