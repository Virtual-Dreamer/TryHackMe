Steps I did:

1) Scanned the maching using rustscan
2) Visited the webpage. Checked the source code of default apache page. 
Ran GoBuster and found:

/admin

<!-- Hey john, if you do not remember, the username is admin -->

4) Used Hydra to bruteforce the login form with the username admin and rockyou.txt password wordlist
5) Downloaded the private rsa key
