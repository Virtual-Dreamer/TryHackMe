Task 1: Library

A) User.txt

Answer: 6d488cbb3f111d135722c33cb635f4ec

B) Root.txt

Answer: e8c8c6c256c35515d1d344ee0488c617

---------------------

Steps I did:

1) Scanned the machine using rustscan
2) Visited the webpage. Found potential username:

meliodas

Checked the source code

3) Brute forced SSH using hydra with username meliodas. Found match:

meliodas:iloveyou1

4) Privesc: Python looks for the imported library firstly in the current directory of where the python file
is being run. In this case, the library zipfile was imported so I created a new python file with the same name
which contains python code to spawn a new shell. And because we can run it as root, we should get a shell as root. 
Then I placed it on the same directory as the original python file and ran the command:

sudo /usr/bin/python /home/meliodas/bak.py

and we got a root shell.
