TryHackMe:Agent-Sudo|

Task 1: 


--------------------

Steps I did:

1) Scanned the machine using rustscan
2) Visited the webpage. Used User-Agent switcher to change user-agent to "C"
3) Used hydra to brute force FTP with username chris. Found password:

crystal

4) Downloaded the files.
5) Inspected all images. Used StegSeek and Binwalk to extract files from images. Decoded the hash using zip2john
6) Logged in to SSH. Downloaded the alien image
7) Used Google reverse image search with the image
8) Ran the command: "sudo -l" to see what commands we can run as root
9) The "!root" indicates that this machine is vulnerable to CVE-2019-14287 sudo bug. The attacker will be able
to be root with the command:

sudo -u#-1 (command here)
